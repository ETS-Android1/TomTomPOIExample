> This is a React-Native Typescript application that serves as an example on how to implement calls to the TomTom Points Of Interest Search API using Native Modules.</br>
> Using React Hooks and React Components we created a custom List View that inflates its children when a TomTom API response is received.</br>
> The Items inside The List View get populated from the Json response received from the API.</br>
> The networking requests are in native android (java) and are returned as a promise to React-Native (Typescript). </br>
> Native module implementation is completed only for the Android platform, iOS is not yet implemented. </br>

### TomTom API Key
**Creating a TomTom Developer Account**
1. [Create a TomTom Developer Account](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/register)
2. Login and go to your [Dashboard](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps)
3. In the Keys Section, Generate and copy an API KEY

**Using your API Key in The Project:**
1. Go inside the android native files and open the TomTomPOIModule Class located in `android/app/src/main/java/com/tomtompoiexample/TomTomPOIModule.java`
2. Inside the class find the `static final String TOMTOM_API_KEY` and put your API key there

## Usage
First you need to start the Metro Javascript bundler. Inside the project root directory run:
```sh
react-native start
```

In order to run the app in a connected android device or emulator run:
```sh
react-native run-android 
```
## Disclaimer
In ordered to be easier to review this code contains A LOT of unneeded comments
But this also makes it better to serve as an example application.
